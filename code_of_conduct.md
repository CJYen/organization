# Code of Conduct

The Women Who Code DC Mission has three main goals:

1. That women software engineers feel confident and empowered to pursue their goals.
1. That every woman codes
1. That all women who code around Washington DC have a community they can access for support and resources.

It is our responsibility as an organization to cultivate a safer environment for all women (and nonbinary people, too). We are committed to being welcoming and embracing of people of all ages, races, ethnicities, nationalities, sexualities, gender expressions, disabilities, religions, skill levels.

This code of conduct applies for all official Women Who Code DC functions, including conversations online.

### No Harrassment Policy

Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussion or events, nonconsensual publication of private comments, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Conduct need not be intentional to be harassment.

Women Who Code DC will not tolerate such behavior and will make efforts to address these issues sensitively and justly. We will not hesitate, if appropriate, to remove or bar entry to visitors, members, or leads who violate the no harrassment policy.

For _Slack_, if a member is reported to have violated our policy or their behavior has created a toxic or hostile environment for the rest of the members in the group, then the following actions are a guideline as to how to handle the situation : 
1. On first offense, a warning will be issued and a dialogue will ensue with one of the leads as to the specific behavior that caused the warning.
2. On second offense, the member's account will be temporarily suspended for a determined amount of time. The member will be notified about the suspension and the reasons why it was enacted in an email.
3. On third offense, the member will be permanently banned.

_NOTE: Based on the severity of the violation, the execution of the actions in these guidelines can be circumvented. If the behavior is so severe that it deems an immediate ban, then it is at the discretion of the leadership team to do so._

### Making a Report

If you see or experience someone violating this code of conduct and would like support from the leadership, you can contact any member of our leadership in person or electronically. Leads will keep these conversations private and take action only with consent of the affected member. You may report this by direct messaging a lead on slack or send an email to _info[at]womenwhocodedc.com_.

Anonymous reporting can also be sent over our slack group. Use the slash command `/report {message}` from any channel and the _{message}_ will be sent anonymously to our leadership team. _NOTE: Because it is anonymous, you will not be able to get a direct response after sending the message. If you would like someone to reply to a situation you've reported, please include your slack handle or email in the message._

When making a report, the following information is useful, but not required:

- Who violated the Code of Conduct?
- Where and when did the violation occurred?
- What happened?
- Who may have witnessed the violation?
- Who are you?


The Leadership Team will make every effort to remain impartial in dealing with Code of Conduct issues. If, for some reason, a Lead can't accept the responsibility of enfocing a Code of Conduct issue, it will be dealt with by other Leads until the issue is resolved.

Please make contributions to this Code of Conduct if you feel you have something to add.
