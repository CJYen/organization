These questions will help you understand the day to day work environment of the company.

*  How much time is spent in meetings vs at the computer doing development?
*  Do you like your job?
    *  Probably best asked of the person who works in a similar role as you'd work in, though asking this question during an interview with HR or someone not technical could be telling.
*  What was the best day you had working here? 
*  What's the worst day you had here?
*  What surprised you most about working here?
*  Which project are you most proud of having worked on?
*  When did the last dev leave and why?
*  When was the last dev let go and why?
