# Tech Questions

These questions help you learn about what kind of tech the company uses and why they've made certain technical decisions.

*  Are there any new tools you plan to implement in the future and what are the plans for integrating the new tech?
*  Do your developers pair program? If so, how frequently?
*  How often do you do code reviews? Is there a consistent procedure across all code reviews?
*  Are the standards revisited or are they just left, as written, i.e. "carved in stone", in 2001?
*  Does the project use continuous integration?
*  Do you have a standard template for estimating development effort for new work to make sure nothing is overlooked?
*  Is there any on-call time as part of the job?
