# Diversity Questions

These questions will help you discern how much a company genuinely cares for different kinds of diversity in the workplace.

*  How many women are on the team I might be joining?
  *  If they are hiring for multiple teams, how many female developers/engineers do they have overall?
*  Can I speak with one of the women who works here?
*  What was your first job and how did you get to your current position?
  *  Diversity of background is also diversity.  As Veni said in Slack, "I feel like a lot of times people forget their own struggles when they were getting started and judge the candidate too harshly. I want to see if this question would remind them of it and have them be more open to people of different backgrounds and experiences."
