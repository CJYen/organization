# Business Questions

These questions help to uncover the health and direction(s) of the business.

*  What's the business model?
*  How does the company get contracts? (if applicable)
*  How does the business (or managers or teams) decide what work to do next?
*  If the company is dependent on contracts, how long can they hold people on overhead if there's no contract?
    * When the last time was that they did that?  For how many people?  For how long?
*  How much input do developers have on product direction?
